They’re present in your commute illuminating info boards and creating hardlight subway cars; the tools you use for your job; and the care you receive when you get injured. You’re hounded by Arbiters over the usage of your gems as they bark at you over the scarcity of gems; meanwhile, you watch as entire building blocks are demolished and built back up again with the power of gems simply because someone higher up ordered it so.\nRumors of an Origin Gem being exchanged between the Trinity Kingdom and the Deepcrystal Enclave have reached your ears as you go about your life.

Any attempts to do so always ended with Crystallization often encompassing a wide area. Many steered clear from gems while few coveted their power enough to continue on despite the danger. This greed and lust for power spurred the creation of weaker and weaker generation gems via crystallization; the pioneers’ attempts and experiments made steady progress but always at the loss of life.\nAs gems became slightly less lethal through the proliferation of we, these pioneers would engage in trades with powerful individuals and families where the pioneer would receive support and the latter would display the gem as a symbol of power. Given the near-guaranteed fatality rate of pioneers, their findings were largely tribal knowledge, and they flaunted stories and knowledge to gain social standing. This led to the formation of the initial gem families.\nThe allure of gems continue to draw in those wishing to come into power, and gems continued to gradually weaken through their recklessness and crystallization. The more people that were able to stake their claim in this rush for gems, the more the powerful families wished to consolidate and regulate the power often resulting in skirmishes between even one another. Some pioneers were tasked with creating weaponry to assist in these wars. Many of these attempts ended in failures and loss of weaponry, but they eventually landed on the use of Runes leading to the first ever Runeographers and Inscriptionists.\nInitial iterations involved rune inscriptions etched directly on the gem, but this was quickly abandoned in favor of inscribing runes on equipment instead of on the gem as the latter severely limited the usefulness of the gem. This combination of runes and equipment exponentially lessened the burden on the user leading to mass adoption of gem weaponry and escalated minor conflicts into full-blown wars. Although powerful, those granted the privilege of wielding such weaponry relied on them too heavily and would fall to the effects of crystallization but not before wiping out swathes of enemies and scarring the lands."},"_history/Gem-Family":{"slug":"_history/Gem-Family","filePath":"_history/Gem Family.md","title":"Gem Family","links":["_theory/Gem-Generation","_theory/Gem"],"tags":["crystalborne/history"],"content":"Gem Family\nA family that owned a powerful early generation Gem which they utilized to gain power.

With the pressures of war no longer bearing down on them, the novel Runeographers and Inscriptionists begin turning to other applications of Gems. These efforts resulted largely in enhanced versions of tools, with the biggest advancement being simple exoskeletons that helped reduce the strength required for laborious tasks (not enhancing the body). These tools greatly increased production speed and quality, but some of the workers using these tools and opportunists understanding the sheer value of gems and gem-enhanced equipment wanted more.\nGem-related crimes began to rise, and these unregulated gems infuriated the gem families who sponsored the creation and distribution of these tools. These families had either become governmental entities or gained a vice-like grip over existing governments following the Commonization wars, and they leveraged their influence to create Arbiters. These arbiters were tasked with regulating, protecting, monitoring, and even forcefully re-acquiring gems. Although this helped reduce gem-related crimes, it enforced the idea that gems were not owned by the public, and it enabled the families to pressure and constrict the Runeographers and Inscriptionists they sponsored.\nThe push for regulation caused the existing nations at the time to concentrate on single, focused locations effectively resulting in megacities and leaving much of the lands unclaimed. Although no one was forced to lived in these regulated societies, many chose to to continue benefitting from the advantages of gems. For those that chose to live elsewhere, they were spared the border checks by Arbiters ensuring unregulated gems aren’t coming in or going out."},"_history/Modernization":{"slug":"_history/Modernization","filePath":"_history/Modernization.md","title":"Modernization","links":["_history/Renaissance","_theory/Gem","_theory/Projection","_people/Arbiter","_theory/Gem-Generation","_history/Gem-Scarcity","_theory/Origin-Gem","_history/Gem-Family","_people/Shardwalker","_places/Shardlands"],"tags":["crystalborne/era","crystalborne/history"],"content":"Modernization\nThe discoveries of the Renaissance launched civilization into a new era littered with new creations based on hardlight.

Transportation created entirely from hardlight allowed for the quick shuttling of groups of people. Civilian-oriented gadgetry &amp; equipment was created and licensed albeit under the intense scrutiny of the Arbiters.\nHowever, the rapid, unabated progress made for multiple eras was beginning to come to a close. Gems, although known to be growing weaker and weaker through the generations, had become too weak—a problem referred to as the Gem Scarcity. The pool of gems became diluted, and Origin Gems were now near impossible to find. The families, now the de facto—if not actual—government, were increasingly anxious as it doubts whether they could sustain the ever-growing dependency on gems grew.

With enough time and sacrificial lambs, the Intrinsic Powers were discovered, documented, and published.\nResilience Profiling\nFurther research eventually lead to the discovery of Resilience, and it was swiftly discovered that this metric was different for each type of material and gem type, and that organic matter has far lower resilience.\nThe published powers caused the masses to develop interest in discovering what gem types they had high resilience in and were therefore compatible with. Testing centers were established in response. Testing was not done freely, and the revenue generated from this only served to cement the wealth and power of the original sponsoring families &amp; authorities.\nDiscovery of Projection\nAnother avenue those sponsored were forced to pursue was the discovery of other applications of gems.

The former type has earned her the moniker of Whispering Death due to their relatively silent nature.\nThe rifle works through a combination of Diamond powder in the bullet casing and the Diamond inlay in the rifle connecting the trigger to the hammer to the bullet. These bullets are difficult to source on her own, but she receives help from The Doctor. She collects the ejected casings to reduce the amount of ones she has to inscribe Runes into. Thankfully, she needs only a little bit of powder to match the power of gunpowder and she can swap in normal bullets if need be.\nAs a last resort, she is able to create primitive projectiles via a Bismuth gadget and can launch them with only the force of Diamond available through the rifle’s inlay.\nHistory\nSilver lived as normal a life one could in the Glowhollow, but the fallout of Operation Hyena brought her way of life and her family to ruin. She took on odd jobs to help her family get by and eventually they took her into the Shardlands. She scrounged her signature rifle from some corpses while out on a job and learned how to work with Gems by restoring it to working order.\nAs her jobs became more involved, she needed a guaranteed way to get past the Prismatic Guard when entering and exiting the Trinity Kingdom. She worked with various smugglers but most often with the Jackals given that both parties didn’t inspire confidence in anyone else. Heimdall would not so subtly hint that she should join them for some added stability to which she reluctantly agreed to after some time.\nTemperament\nCautious out of fear but a risk-taker out of necessity, she is willing to do whatever it takes to take care of her family. This often leads to clashes between her and Heimdall who largely goes off of feeling.\nTrivia\n\nBased on Silver Squad, Anby, Trigger from ZZZ\nBased on Lady Nagant from MHA\n"},"_people/Stoneshire":{"slug":"_people/Stoneshire","filePath":"_people/Stoneshire.md","title":"Stoneshire","links":["_history/Gem-Family","_places/Trinity-Kingdom","_history/Modernization"],"tags":["crystalborne/history","crystalborne/person"],"content":"Stoneshire\nA Gem Family powerful enough to found the Trinity Kingdom.
